  returned in DriverName, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned. If the driver specified

  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller

  This function retrieves the user readable name of the controller specified by

  Language, then a pointer to the controller name is returned in ControllerName,

  support the language specified by Language, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
